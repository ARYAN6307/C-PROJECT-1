 which simply silent the system. 
The sound() is very useful as it can create very nice music with the help of programming and our user can enjoy music during working in out the program. 
These two functions are from file dos. h, which should be included in the program.

Delay in C: 
delay function is used to suspend execution of a program for a particular time.
